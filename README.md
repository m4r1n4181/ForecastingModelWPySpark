# Online Retail Sales Forecasting with PySpark
A project for analyzing sales data and predicting product quantity using PySpark.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an online retail dataset and building a Random Forest regression model to predict the quantity of products sold. The dataset is processed using PySpark, and the model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

# Main Objectives
✔ Aggregate sales data into daily intervals
✔ Split data into training and testing sets based on "2011-09-25"
✔ Train a Random Forest Regression model to predict sales quantity
✔ Evaluate model performance using MAE
✔ Identify total sales prediction for Week 39 of 2011
